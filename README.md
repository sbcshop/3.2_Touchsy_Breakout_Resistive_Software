  _Display Control Pins:_
  | Pin No. | Symbol | Description |
  |---|---|---|
  | 5 | CS | Chip select pin for SPI interfacing |
  | 7 | CLK  | Clock pin for SPI interfacing |
  | 9 | D/C | Data/Command pin, Logic HIGH for Data and Logic LOW for Command   |
  | 11 | DIN | MOSI pin for SPI interfacing |
  | 13 | RST | Reset pin |
  | 18 | BL | BackLight for Display panel |
  
  _Touch Control Pins:_
  | Pin no. | Symbol | Description | 
  |---|---|---|
  | 1 | T_CS | Chip Select pin for SPI interfacing |
  | 15 | T_CK | Clock pin for SPI interfacing|
  | 3 | T_DI  | Data In (MOSI) pin for SPI interfacing |
  | 22 | T_DO | Data Out (MISO) pin for SPI interfacing |
  | 20 | IRQ | Touch Controller Interrupt pin, Logic LOW when touch detected |
  
  **Note:** RST & TRS pins connected internally so while interfacing with MCU's GPIO you can use only one instead of both
  
   _Power Pins:_
  | Pin no. | Symbol | Description | 
  |---|---|---|
  | 17 | GND | Common Supply Ground pin |
  | 19 | 5V  | 5V Input Supply |
  | 21 | VCC | High Side Supply for Level Shifter, Not required when using with 3.3V/5V MCU| 
  | 22 | 3V3 | 3.3V Input Supply |
  
  **Note:** Using only one supply 5V or 3.3V at a time is enough to power Display Module

  ## Interfacing 
  ### Interfacing Breakout with Pico W
  - Follow below wiring diagram for connection
